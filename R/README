How to use TTOSOM

All parameters must be strings, including learning rate, etc. this is because the integration with java.


The parameters are: 

	dataset the training arff file 
	topology The topology is specified in a text file in one line specifying the number of children per node following the guidelines of the describe topopology method described in
	iterations the total number of training iterations
	initRadius initial value for the radius of the bubble of activity
	finalRadius final value for the radius of the bubble of activity
	initLearning initial value for the learning rate.
	finalLearning final value for the learning rate.
	distance the type of distance, 0: Euclidean 1: Manhattan
	input -i for input file
	inputFile the source file where a TTOSOM (including topology and values for the weights) will be loaded.
	output -o for output file
	outputFile the source file where a TTOSOM (including topology and values for the weights) will be saved.
	stats -x for cross validation, -t for test set ,-c for clustering
	option_stats number of folds if -x in stats, path test set if -t in stats, nothing if -c in stats
	seed -s for seed value
	seed_value the new value of the seed


You must have the "rJava" package installed.

For more details about the parameters go to the Java folder and open README
