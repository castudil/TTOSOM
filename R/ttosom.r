# All parameters must be strings, including learning rate, etc. this is because the integration with java.
# + dataset the training arff file 
# + topology The topology is specified in a text file in one line specifying the number of children per node following the guidelines of the describe topopology method described in
# + iterations the total number of training iterations
# + initRadius initial value for the radius of the bubble of activity
# + finalRadius final value for the radius of the bubble of activity
# + initLearning initial value for the learning rate.
# + finalLearning final value for the learning rate.
# + distance the type of distance, 0: Euclidean 1: Manhattan
# + input -i for input file
# + inputFile the source file where a TTOSOM (including topology and values for the weights) will be loaded.
# + output -o for output file
# + outputFile the source file where a TTOSOM (including topology and values for the weights) will be saved.
# + stats -x for cross validation, -t for test set ,-c for clustering
# + option_stats number of folds if -x in stats, path test set if -t in stats, nothing if -c in stats
# + seed -s for seed value
# + seed_value the new value of the seed
